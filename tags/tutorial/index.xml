      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to get a Raspberry Pi. I&amp;rsquo;ve already thought a long time of buying one, but because of missing ideas what to do with it I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy one. A school project came by which served the perfect reason to finally buy one (hint: self made monitoring camera) and now I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to have one.
Mopidy and stuff So what is running on my RPI now? Currently there is a raspian installed and except the whole music-server-software nothing special.</description>

What I personally like the most is list comprehension, this is a really powerful and great feature. But there are also other really cool things like maybe for example. It is really packed with a lot of cool stuff.</description>
