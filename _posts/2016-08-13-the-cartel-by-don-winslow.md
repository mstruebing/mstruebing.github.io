[![The Cartel by Don Winslow](/img/books/the-cartel.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23602561-the-cartel)

It was published in 2015 and is the great successor of [The Power of The Dog](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206236.The_Power_of_the_Dog), which I finished also this year [Blog Post]({{site.url}}/books/2016/05/26/the-power-of-the-dog-by-don-winslow.html).

The book continues the story about Art Keller, Adan Barrerra and the American/Mexican drug war .  It is a real
masterpiece and real nice to read. It is full of brutality and I love how real it
appears. If you ever have seen some documentations or movies about the mob you
will get the much similarities. I also love the character evolving and
relationships and how they are find together or break up.

The main story is about new guys which are former soldiers who wants to be part of the drug trade and are
more brutal than others before to get their place.

The best is that the book never gets boring, it is fun and exciting all the time.

It is really interesting how all the different kind of people get connected to the
mob. A journalist, a beauty queen, a football star, a child etc.

Nina is a real cooler person and it is nice to follow the story between her and
Adan, even if it does not end like you think. She is his mistress but somehow much
more than this, she is more of a adviser and friend for Adan. His only friend he
have.

I also really like the character evolving of Art and Adan, it seems like they grow
up while the book goes on.
Also noticeable is Chuey, who literally grew up in the mob and is really sick in
his mind, even if he does not really want to be part of the mob. He wants to run
away but was pushed back into two times. Poor Chuey. 

And of course the last part where Adan and Art working together is really nice to
read. It is the last chance they have to bash the new guys. Two guys who
literally hate each other over I think like 20 or 30 years are working together.
One of them set a bounty on the other, a bounty of 2 million dollar. They play it
nice even if the end is really disturbing and they does not break up like they
said or one would think.

I really like this book.
