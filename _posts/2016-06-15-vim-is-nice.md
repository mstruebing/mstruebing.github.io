I've currently started using [vim](http://www.vim.org/) which is really 
pleasant.
I also switched to [neovim](https://neovim.io/) quickly.
Neovim is basically vim with some useful default settings.

I could recommend that you use `vimtutor` to learn the basics and additionally
read this good peace of book [VimLikeAPro](https://leanpub.com/VimLikeAPro)

I had to laugh sometimes when reading about some features because I really didn't 
expect that 
they are in vim and especially right out of the box. My favorites of them are 
code completion even from various buffers and copy/paste registers.

What is said nearly everywhere is that you have to learn to move well in vim, 
and this is really true. Only if you could move well you have the cow powers
of vim. Of course you can do without, but than you could use every other editor
instead of vim. 

I'm currently in the beginning of getting used to vim, but I try to use it
every time and I really like it. Sometimes I had to think about how the 'command'
is done what I want to achieve or have to do a quick google search. But like all
new things this is total normal at the beginning, the more you do and try the more
you know automatically how to achieve your wanted goal.

I think you need a while to really know the most stuff you need about vim, but
even if you don't know this all vim is useful and makes your editor experience
a lot better.

Another really advantage is that it is installed on nearly every unix system or
easily can be installed. Than you only need your dotfiles and have your complete
configuration and you can work like usual.
It is running in a terminal so you can use it on servers or other computers where
you connect over ssh. No gui needed, so it is also fast. Use terminal commands(!),
make specific keymappings for specific filetypes like save and compile in one step
etc. You could also use specific key-mappings for every mode of vim (insert, visual, etc)
and also specific per filetype like save and compile on a specific keystroke etc. There are no limits to your creativity.

Just try to start using vim, if you don't like it or it's features you could
cancel it anyway, but you should at least tried.
