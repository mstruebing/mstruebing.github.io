[![Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk](/img/books/fight-club.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5759.Fight_Club)

It was first published in 1996 and tells an impressive and fictive story of a schizophrenic man.   
I've seen the movie first and was a bit disappointed after I've read the book because it doesn't come up with something new.
This is one of the few movies which are as good as the books.
It is easy to read and I had read it in the subway while on my way to work and home mostly. It was the perfect book for this, because it switches situations 
as fast as you can blink and so it isn't hard to get re-into it after a break.
I imagine that it is really confusing at first if you haven't seen the movie before, new situation here, new situation there, creepy thoughts in mind and so on.

To be honest I don't know what I could say about this book, but since I wanted to write some sentences about __every__ book I've read I have to write this short post.
