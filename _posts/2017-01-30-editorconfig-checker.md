If you work with several people on the same project it often occurs that
you will see different indentation sizes. Everyone who is a programmer knows 
this kind of pain.

So someone thought lets make a file which the different text-editors 
can read and indent their code blocks like defined in that file.

But what if the humans who are using the text-editors didn't tell their
text-editor(or IDE) that it should read that file?
Then it changes nothing and the old pain is back.

There are some tools out there which promise to solve the same issue as me, but not a single one in the php/composer world.
