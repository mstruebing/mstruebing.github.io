I just finished
[Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14062004-thinking-fast-and-slow) by 
[Daniel Kahneman](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/72401.Daniel_Kahneman). :)

It was published in 2012 and got a lot of attention even from people like [Bill Gates](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/07/nine-books-bill-gates-is-reading-this-summer/).
So when I saw it in a book store I had to buy it. It took me a while to go through the complete book but it was definitely worth it.
It was extremely interesting how he explained your mind works with a lot of great examples, studies and experiments he and others made.
Often it was a bit absurd like in the cold hand experiment which was explained by [Duration neglect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duration_neglect).
One interesting part was the contrast of the two systems of your brain - like he described it, which were referred throughout the whole book.
The one is very quick and often gives a good explanation of stuff which seems right at first but the other is way more logical and precise and often find errors
of the other system.
But the most interesting part was how we make decisions and what happens in our brain that we are able to decide so stupid things sometimes.

It is definitely worth a read for everyone.
